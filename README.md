For fun code following lesson 2 of the fastai online course. 

## Necessary Python Packages
To use this, you'll need fastai, ipywidgets, and voila. I'm honestly not sure
what else you may need, but it'll come up... :>

```bash
pip install ipywidgets
```

Some versions of these packages don't work. Make sure ipywidgets is >v8.

## Use
```bash
voila app.ipynb
```
The voila page will give an upload button; upload an image there.
